            No conversation about all-time famous writers, regardless of language, is complete without including William Shakespeare. He is the towering figure in English Literature who changed the complexion and took English drama to new heights. The level of competence and skill showcased by Shakespeare was hardly ever matched by anyone till now.

            He wrote during the Elizabethan Age. Most of his works were produced during the period from 1591-1611. He is still known for his universal appeal, handle over language and meter like no other. His characterization is unparalleled, which came to the forefront, especially in his tragedies.

            When you talk about poetry and famous poets, the conversation must start with Wordsworth. He single-handedly brought a trend in English Literature. He is so famous for his poetry that his name can be synonymously used for Romanticism. His work can be best defined as imbibed with an appreciation for nature and the tender side of life and emotion.

            His influence on his contemporary and later generations is immense. He is best known for Lyrical Ballad, which was co-written by S.T. Coleridge. He wrote plenty of other amazing poetry that is still read to this day. Some of his most popular works include “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,” “The Solitary Reaper,” “The Lucy Poems,” and more...</p>

            Wilde’s most famous play, “The Importance of Being Earnest,” is a classic of comedic theatre, and his novel “The Picture of Dorian Gray” remains a thought-provoking masterpiece.
